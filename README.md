### Hi 👋 , I'm Abhinav Arun

I possess a multifaceted portfolio of Data Science experience that encompasses a diverse spectrum of domains, ranging from Recommender Systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Graph Machine Learning, experimental design to Statistical modeling (Bayesian vs frequentist) and more. My journey in data science has seen me successfully navigate and excel across these distinct domains, a testament to my adaptability, analytical prowess, and commitment to embracing varied challenges. This well-rounded expertise equips me with the capability to holistically approach complex problems, draw insights from diverse datasets, and construct robust solutions that transcend conventional boundaries. 

My educational background, underscored by my professional journey, empowers me with a unique confluence of theoretical depth and applied mastery in data science and technology. 
I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computational Data Analytics from Georgia Tech, an institution recognized for its rigorous curriculum and dedication to fostering analytical prowess. I also hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur, one of the most revered engineering institutes in India.

I recently concluded my Internship at Prudential Financial in their Chief Data Office as a Graduate Data Science Intern. I worked on a project centered around exploring the synergies between Graph machine learning and NLP. This experience honed my ability to translate complex technical concepts into actionable insights, ensuring seamless communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Prior to this, I have had 3+ years of work experience as a Senior Data Associate at Innovaccer Inc., a Silicon Valley based healthcare analytics company that provides data driven solutions to various hospital systems and provider groups. I worked on scalable and deployment-ready solutions like “Predicting the probability of Readmission” & “Recommendation Engine for In-Network Post Acute Care expansion” , which helped me significantly in understanding the entire journey from unstructured heterogeneous pools of data to a user-friendly product through the lens of Data Science & Analytics.


I am a big sports buff and enjoy playing and watching various sports like Soccer, Cricket etc. I am a die-hard Real Madrid fan , Hala Madrid!
