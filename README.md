### Hi ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Abhinav Arun

I possess a multifaceted portfolio of data science experience that encompasses a diverse spectrum of domains, ranging from Recommender Systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Graph Machine Learning, experimental design to Statistical modeling (Bayesian vs frequentist) and more. My journey in data science has seen me successfully navigate and excel across these distinct domains, a testament to my adaptability, analytical prowess, and commitment to embracing varied challenges. This well-rounded expertise equips me with the capability to holistically approach complex problems, draw insights from diverse datasets, and construct robust solutions that transcend conventional boundaries. 

My educational background, underscored by my professional journey, empowers me with a unique confluence of theoretical depth and applied mastery in data science and technology. 
I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computational Data Analytics from Georgia Tech,
an institution recognized for its rigorous curriculum and dedication to fostering analytical prowess. This academic foundation has equipped me with a mastery of statistical analysis, programming languages, and data manipulation techniques, providing me with a comprehensive toolkit for translation my skill sets into solving real world data science problems.
I also hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree from IIT Kharagpur, one of the most revered engineering institutes in India and it was here that I embarked on a journey in the field of Data Science & Analytics which has been growing with each passing day.

I recently concluded my Internship at Prudential Financial in their Chief Data Office as a Graduate Data Science Intern. I worked on a project centered around exploring the synergies between Graph machine learning and NLP. This experience honed my ability to translate complex technical concepts into actionable insights, ensuring seamless communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.


I am a big sports buff and enjoy playing and watching various sports like Soccer, Cricket etc. I am a die-hard Real Madrid fan , Hala Madrid!
